    <h3>SCENE II
    Damis, Orgon, Cleante</h3>
    
    <h6 class="name">Damis.</h6>  <p class="Speech Damis">Father, is it true that this cad threatens you,<br>
            That he has forgotten the gifts that bound you two,<br>
            And that his shameful pride, maddeningly,<br>
            Has repaid your kindness with tyranny?</p>
    <h6 class="name">Orgon.</h6>  <p class="Speech Orgon">Yes, son; he's brought me to the verge of tears.</p>
    <h6 class="name">Damis.</h6>  <p class="Speech Damis">Leave him to me.  I'll cut off his ears.<br>
            You must not flinch before his insolence<br>
            For I'll soon restore your independence,<br>
            And, to end the matter, I'll slice him like toast.</p>
