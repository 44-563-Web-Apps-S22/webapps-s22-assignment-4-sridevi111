    <h3> SCENE I. - Orgon, Cleante.</h3>
<h6 class ="name Cleante"> Cleante.</h6>  <p class="speech">Where are you rushing?</p>
<h6 class ="name Orgon">Orgon.</h6>    <p class="speech">Who knows?</p>
<h6 class ="name Cleante">Cleante.</h6>  <p class="speech">It might make sense<br>
        To begin by having a conference<br>
        About everything that has happened lately.</p>
<h6 class ="name Cleante">Cleante.</h6>  <p class="speech">That box of papers troubles me greatly;<br>
        More than all the rest, it's cause for distress.</p>
<h6 class ="name Cleante">Cleante.</h6>  <p class="speech">Why are those papers important to possess?</p>
<h6 class ="name Orgon">Orgon.</h6>  <p class="speech">My unfortunate friend Argus, when he<br>
        Put them into my hands, swore me to secrecy.<br>
        He chose to rely on me as he fled,<br>
        And these papers, according to what he said,<br>
        Are crucial to both his life and his wealth.</p>
<h6 class ="name Cleante">Cleante.</h6>  <p class="speech">Then why didn't you keep them to yourself?</p>
<h6 class ="name Orgon">Orgon.</h6>  <p class="speech">It was a matter of conscience, you see,<br>
        So I consulted Tartuffe in secrecy,<br>
        And his arguments came to persuade me
        That he should keep the box for security,<br>
        So I could deny having it on hand.<br>
        And thus I'd have a subterfuge on demand<br>
        With which my conscience might muddle through<br>
        In swearing to things that I knew weren't true.</p>
<h6 class ="name Cleante">Cleante.</h6>  <p class="speech">You're in trouble, judging by appearances;<br>
        Both the deed of gift and these confidences<br>
        Are, to tell you my thoughts quite honestly,<br>
        Measures that you took very thoughtlessly.<br>
        They might put you in jail with such evidence,<br>
        And since that man has it, it makes no sense<br>
        To drive him away through your imprudence,<br>
        You need to regain his full confidence.</p>
<h6 class ="name Orgon">Orgon.</h6>  <p class="speech">With what a fair appearance and touching zeal<br>
        He hides a wicked soul and a heart of steel!<br>
        And I, who received him begging and broke . . .<br>
        That's it, I renounce all such pious folk.<br>
        Henceforth, I will hold them as wholly evil<br>
        And do my best to send them to the devil.</p>
<h6 class ="name Cleante">Cleante.</h6>  <p class="speech">It's just like you to get carried away!<br>
        You can never stick to the middle way.<br>
        To reason rightly is too much bother;<br>
        You always rush from one excess to another.<br>
        You can see your error and now you know<br>
        That by a false zeal you were brought low.<br>
        But to redeem yourself does logic demand<br>
        That you embrace an error that's even more grand?<br>
        And must you confuse the heart of a shill<br>
        With the hearts of all the men of good will?<br>
        Because a rascal had the luck or grace<br>
        To dupe you with his austere and shining face,<br>
        Must you believe everyone acts that way<br>
        And no true church-man can be found today?<br>
        Leave to libertines these foolish deductions.<br>
        Seek true virtue, not a false deconstruction.<br>
        Never rush into hasty admiration,<br>
        And strive instead for moderation.<br>
        If possible, don't admire false pretense,<br>
        But also don't give true zeal cause for offense,<br>
        And if you must fall to one extreme,<br>
        Err in being too free with your esteem.</p>
